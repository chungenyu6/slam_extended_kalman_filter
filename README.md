  Course Project - SLAM based on Extended Kalman Filter
</h1>

## Notice
- My teammates and I provided a solution for implementing SLAM techniques, and these codes are 
all for education purpose, but if there are any issues with the authorization, please contact me, 
I will immediately remove them.

- The whole package is implemented on ROS and simulated with turtlebots.

- More details please look into the report pdf.
